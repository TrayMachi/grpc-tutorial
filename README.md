1. **Key differences between unary, server streaming, and bi-directional streaming RPC:**
   - **Unary RPC:** Client sends a single request and receives a single response.  
     *Use case:* Simple CRUD operations, authentication, or any request/response interaction.
   - **Server Streaming RPC:** Client sends a single request, server sends a stream of responses.  
     *Use case:* Fetching logs, transaction histories, or any scenario where multiple results are returned for a single query.
   - **Bi-directional Streaming RPC:** Both client and server send streams of messages to each other independently.  
     *Use case:* Real-time chat, collaborative editing, live telemetry, or any interactive session.

2. **Security considerations in Rust gRPC:**
   - **Authentication:** Use TLS mutual authentication or token-based mechanisms (e.g., JWT). Tonic supports TLS via `tonic::transport::Server::tls_config`.
   - **Authorization:** Implement middleware/interceptors to check permissions before handling requests.
   - **Data Encryption:** Always enable TLS to encrypt data in transit. Avoid transmitting sensitive data in plaintext.
   - **Other:** Validate all inputs, handle errors securely, and keep dependencies up to date.

3. **Challenges with bidirectional streaming in Rust gRPC:**
   - **Concurrency:** Managing multiple simultaneous streams and ensuring thread safety.
   - **Backpressure:** Handling slow consumers or producers to avoid memory bloat.
   - **Error Handling:** Propagating and recovering from errors in either direction.
   - **Resource Management:** Preventing leaks by properly closing channels and streams.
   - **Ordering:** Ensuring message order if required by the application.

4. **Advantages and disadvantages of `tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream`:**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Simple integration with async channels.
     - Decouples producer and consumer logic.
     - Leverages Tokioâ€™s async runtime for efficiency.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Buffer size must be tuned to avoid blocking or memory issues.
     - Error handling is manual; dropped senders/receivers can cause silent failures.
     - Not suitable for all streaming patterns (e.g., if you need backpressure propagation).

5. **Structuring Rust gRPC code for reuse and modularity:**
   - Separate service definitions, implementations, and proto-generated code into modules.
   - Use traits for service logic to allow for mocking and testing.
   - Extract common logic (e.g., authentication, logging) into middleware/interceptors.
   - Organize client and server code in distinct modules or crates.
   - Use dependency injection for configuration and shared resources.

6. **Enhancing `MyPaymentService` for complex payment logic:**
   - Integrate with external payment gateways/APIs.
   - Add input validation and error handling.
   - Implement transaction management (e.g., rollback on failure).
   - Log transactions and audit trails.
   - Handle idempotency and duplicate requests.
   - Support asynchronous processing and status polling.

7. **Impact of gRPC adoption on distributed system architecture:**
   - **Interoperability:** gRPC supports multiple languages, easing cross-platform integration.
   - **Strong Typing:** Protocol Buffers enforce schema consistency.
   - **Streaming:** Enables efficient real-time communication.
   - **Drawbacks:** Requires clients to support HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers; may not be ideal for browser-based clients without additional tooling.

8. **HTTP/2 (gRPC) vs HTTP/1.1 (REST/WebSocket):**
   - **Advantages of HTTP/2:**
     - Multiplexed streams over a single connection.
     - Built-in support for streaming and flow control.
     - Header compression reduces overhead.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - More complex protocol, harder to debug.
     - Limited browser support for gRPC (requires gRPC-Web).
     - Some proxies/load balancers may not fully support HTTP/2.

9. **REST request-response vs gRPC bidirectional streaming:**
   - **REST:** One request, one response; not suitable for real-time or long-lived connections.
   - **gRPC Streaming:** Supports real-time, low-latency, and interactive communication; both client and server can send messages independently.
   - **Responsiveness:** gRPC streaming is more responsive for real-time apps (e.g., chat, live updates).

10. **Schema-based (gRPC/Protobuf) vs schema-less (REST/JSON):**
    - **gRPC/Protobuf:**
      - Enforces strict contracts, enabling compile-time checks and efficient serialization.
      - Easier to evolve APIs with backward/forward compatibility.
      - Requires code generation and schema management.
    - **REST/JSON:**
      - Flexible, easy to use and debug.
      - No enforced schema, which can lead to inconsistencies.
      - Less efficient for large or binary data.
